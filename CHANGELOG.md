# Changelog

## [4.0.0-R3] — 2026-04-16 — Optimizer that Learns

R3 makes the optimizer target its own weak spots, makes the pairwise judge LLM-backed with a cache, and moves composite scoring from hardcoded constants to per-workspace yaml. Slice A (R3.1–R3.6) and Slice B (R3.7–R3.13) are both shipped.

**Expansion plan:** [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-XX-agentlab-r3-smart-optimizer.md](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-XX-agentlab-r3-smart-optimizer.md) — source of truth for acceptance tests (§7) and risk/mitigation matrix (§8).

### Added — Slice A: Coverage-aware proposer + reflection feedback

- **Coverage-gap signal** (`evals/coverage.py`) — `CoverageAnalyzer.gap_signal()` / `gap_signal_dict()` surface under-tested components ranked by severity.
- **Coverage signal in proposer prompt** (`optimizer/llm_proposer.py`) — `LLMProposer` receives a `coverage_signal` kwarg and injects a "Surface X has only N cases" block into the prompt.
- **Reflection wrapper** (`optimizer/reflection.py`) — `ReflectionEngine.read_surface_effectiveness(surface)` returns `{strategy: effectiveness_score}` from the existing `surface_effectiveness` table (no schema migration — see deferred list).
- **Epsilon-greedy strategy ranking** (`optimizer/proposer.py`) — `Proposer._rank_strategies` weights by reflection effectiveness with ε=0.1 exploration. Deterministic under a seeded `random.Random`.
- **`--explain-strategy`** (`agentlab optimize`) — prints one rationale line per ranked strategy with effectiveness scores and any exploration picks.
- **Auto-grown eval cases** (`optimizer/loop.py`) — `Optimizer._maybe_auto_grow_cases()` fires `CardCaseGenerator` per surface when coverage drops below 30%. Gated on `auto_grow_cases` flag; defaults off in test.

### Added — Slice B: LLM judge + configurable weights + calibrated statistics

- **LLM pairwise judge** (`evals/judges/pairwise_judge.py`) — `PairwiseLLMJudge` now routes to an LLM backend with structured output (`{winner, confidence, rationale}`), a SQLite-backed cache (`.agentlab/llm_judge_cache.db`, 30-day TTL keyed on sha256 of both inputs+outputs), and a strict-live escalation mode. Heuristic path remains the default and the fallback.
- **Composite weights yaml** (`evals/composite_weights.py`) — `CompositeWeights` loads from `eval.composite.weights.{quality,safety,latency,cost}` in `agentlab.yaml`. Defaults match pre-R3 constants, validator rejects `sum != 1.0`.
- **`agentlab eval weights`** (`cli/commands/eval.py`) — new `show / set / validate` subcommands for reading and mutating the weights block.
- **Weights snapshot per score** (`evals/scorer.py`) — `CompositeScore.weights_snapshot` freezes the weights used at scoring time. `CompositeScore.rerender(score, weights=None)` classmethod re-renders a historical score under its snapshot (or an override), immune to yaml mutations.
- **Richer paired significance** (`evals/statistics.py`) — `paired_significance()` gained `confidence_interval` (bootstrap, `n_bootstrap=2000` default, seedable) and `calibrated_effect_size` (delta / stddev_diffs). New kwargs: `bootstrap_ci=True`, `n_bootstrap=2000`, `min_calibrated_effect=0.0`. The `is_significant` gate now requires `p < alpha AND abs(calibrated_effect) >= min_calibrated_effect`.

### Deferred (tracked in plan §11)

Strategy-dimension reflection schema; persistence of auto-grown cases back into the workspace dataset; yaml comment preservation on `eval weights set`; `ConstrainedScorer` objective-weight migration; JSON round-trip of `CompositeWeights` inside `CompositeScore.weights_snapshot`; live LLM judge calibration harness; strategy-level lineage events.

## [4.0.0-R1] — 2026-04-16 — Trust the Loop: Strict-Live Enforcement

The first slice of the R1–R6 roadmap turns every silent mock fallback into
a loud, actionable signal. The loop now refuses to pretend.

### Added

**Strict-Live Policy** (`cli/strict_live.py`, `cli/exit_codes.py`)
- `--strict-live` flag on `agentlab eval run`, `agentlab build`, and `agentlab optimize` — abort instead of silently falling back to mock execution
- Distinct exit codes for CI: `12` (mock fallback under strict-live), `13` (deploy on degraded eval), `14` (live mode requested but no provider key)
- `MockFallbackError` raised with a formatted breakdown of every mock warning the run accumulated

**Structured Rejection Records** (`optimizer/gates.py`, `optimizer/loop.py`)
- `RejectionReason` enum: `SAFETY_VIOLATION`, `REGRESSION_DETECTED`, `NO_SIGNIFICANT_IMPROVEMENT`, `GATE_FAILED`, `COVERAGE_INSUFFICIENT`
- `RejectionRecord` dataclass with `attempt_id`, `reason`, `detail`, optional baseline/candidate scores, metadata
- `Optimizer.recent_rejections(limit=None)` returns a 200-entry ring buffer (newest first)
- Matching `attempt_id` across `RejectionRecord` and the persisted `OptimizationAttempt` for correlation

**Improvement List Surfacing** (`agentlab improve list`)
- `improve` group is now visible in `--help` (was hidden)
- REASON column in text output, `reason` field in JSON
- `--reason <value>` filter (values: `safety_violation`, `regression_detected`, `no_significant_improvement`, `gate_failed`, `coverage_insufficient`)
- `AGENTLAB_TEST_FORCE_REJECTION` env var for CLI e2e testing

**Deploy Verdict Gate**
- `agentlab deploy` blocks when the latest eval verdict is `Degraded` or `Needs Attention` (exits `13`)
- Override: `--force-deploy-degraded --reason "<justification>"` (minimum 10 chars)
- Dry-run is NOT exempt — a dry-run of an unsafe deploy is still unsafe

**Provider Key Validation** (`cli/provider_keys.py`)
- Conservative validator: rejects keys < 20 chars, keys with whitespace, and clearly mismatched prefixes (e.g. `sk-ant-...` pasted into `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Onboarding retries up to 3 times on bad input, then aborts instead of silently saving garbage
- `agentlab init` now prompts for a provider key when interactive and the environment is bare; `InitFlow(interactive=False)` added for scripted use

**Doctor Mock-Reason Clarity** (`cli/mock_reason.py`)
- `agentlab doctor` distinguishes three states: `disabled` (green), `configured` (yellow; YAML opt-in), `missing_provider_key` (red; forced by missing env var)
- JSON output: `mock_reason` and `mock_reason_detail` fields
- Text output: a `Fix:` hint specific to each reason

### Changed

- `optimizer.proposer.Proposer()` default is now `use_mock=False`. The optimizer loop no longer silently constructs a mock proposer when the caller omits one.
- Loud errors replace silent skips across eval/build/optimize when `--strict-live` is in effect.

### Tests

Over 80 new tests across `test_exit_codes.py`, `test_strict_live.py`, `test_eval_strict_live.py`, `test_strict_live_propagation.py`, `test_proposer_default_live.py`, `test_gates_rejection.py`, `test_loop_rejections.py`, `test_improve_list_rejections.py`, `test_deploy_verdict_gate.py`, `test_provider_keys.py`, `test_onboarding_validation.py`, `test_init_flow_provider.py`, `test_template_mock_audit.py`, `test_mock_reason.py`, `test_doctor_mock_reason.py`.

### Migration notes

- Existing `--require-live` flag on `eval run` is preserved for backwards compatibility; `--strict-live` is the new canonical name and implies `--require-live`.
- No config changes required. Users who depend on mock mode in automation should pass `--no-strict-live` (the default) or set `optimizer.use_mock: true` explicitly — which will now show up as "configured" rather than "missing key" in `agentlab doctor`.
